Hi, Eldad Shneor, aka @tkss15. I'm a software engineering student at Ort-Braude. 
Coding is a significant part of my life. If you would like to contact me, you can reach me by email at eldadshneor@gmail.com. I code in C, Java, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python. I'm always striving to expand my knowledge and learn more.
